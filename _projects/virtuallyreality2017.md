Our project was to create an experience to benefit the elderly and infirm within spaces such as nursing homes or hospitals. Many individuals in these situations tend to not perform enough physical activity in their day to day, which has been clinically shown to improve patients' overall health and reduce both their time within the hospital and number of returning visits.

We created a prototype to solve both these problems by encouraging movement in friendlier spaces, such as parks or nature reserves while using exercise an HOVR leg swing (now known as SITFLOW) and using their hands to interact with the environment.

	<!-- • Problem: Assist elderly and infirm achieve needed physical activity by encouraging activity with virtual park walks
	• What I did?
		Create a number of interactions to keep the user interacting
		Iterate on ways to track user's movements while on a pedaling device
		Gave directional orientation controls as a fail-safe to assist users who may veer off the predesignated path
		Helped design the environment
Surprisingly, Many people found it very easy to figure out the controls as they were not too far from just walking -->
