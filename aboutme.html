	<p>Hi. my name is Peter Iordanov and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Science.
	In high school, I was in the Boy Scouts of America, and became an Eagle Scout. I competed with my school robotics Team 4676 in FIRST Robotics, and served in my local church as an altar boy. I was ordained by His Grace Bishop Daniel to the sub-deaconate in March of 2013.
	My hobbies include short story writing, poetry and short fiction writing, and gaming.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM SigSoft (an ACM special interest group for software development), and the Bulgarian Association. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume.pdf">resume</a>!</p>
