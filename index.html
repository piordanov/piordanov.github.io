					<h4>Eagle Scout</h4>
					<h5>2013</h5>
					<p>
					One of my greatest achievements was to earn Scouting's highest acheivement, Eagle Rank.<br/>
					Among the requirements to earn Boy Scouting's highest rank, Eagle, is to "plan, develop, and give leadership to a service project for any religious organization or any school or community."
					My Eagle Scout Project involved landscaping around my home parish of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. I planned when the project would take place, and got approval from both the parish and Scouting officials to go ahead with the project. Projects around the parish grounds included replacing the liner and rocks on one side of the hall, placing grass seed and new dirt around the hall, thorough weeding, and painting the church's picnic benches.
					The project was a huge success, and the parish community has been grateful since.

					<h4>Voronoi Applet</h4>
					<h5>2014</h5>
					<p>
					I designed a Java applet to display Voronoi diagrams during my research internship at the <a href= "http://www.upcomillas.es/en/">Comillas Pontificial University</a> in Madrid, Spain. The applet itself and its details are available on my <a href="https://github.com/piordanov/Voronoi">Github</a>. There you can download and run it on your system as long as you have Java 8. It's still a work in progress so please PM me if you discover any bugs or have any comments.
