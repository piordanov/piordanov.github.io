# Project Cat
Spring 2017

A Virtual Reality project for class CS 498 VR where several developers and designers (including myself) made a multiplayer fighting game. We made our own hand tracking controls and set up multiplayer networking using Photon Cloud. Our project was opened source and available [here](https://github.com/piordanov/ProjectCat)
