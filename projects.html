	<dt><h3>This Website</h3></dt><dt>
	</dt><dd>This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through cPanel File Manager. I also implemented my own novel feature to the website by adding reference links to outside websites, unordered lists, html graphics (colors and lines), and a button menu display involving css.</dd>

        <dt><h3>Eagle Scout Service Project</h3></dt><dt>
        </dt><dd>One of the requirements to earn the Boy Scout highest rank, Eagle, is to "Plan, develop, and give leadership to a service project for any religious organization or any school or community." <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/sitecore/content/Scouting/About/FactSheets/EagleScouts.aspx">Click here</a> for further information on the requirements to earn Eagle rank. My project involved landscaping around my home parish of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. I planned when the project would take place, and got approval from both the parish and Scouting officials to go ahead with the project. Projects around the parish grounds included replacing the liner and rocks on one side of the hall, placing grass seed and new dirt around the hall, thorough weeding, and painting the church's picnic benches. The project was a huge success, and the parish community was very happy with the result.</dd>
